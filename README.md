## Overview

**Project Title**: Modern Shared Calendar

**Project Description**: A calendar that is intended to be shared with a family unit. 

**Project Goals**: Create a place to store sign-in and event data. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Just go to the website

Instructions for using the software:

1. Create an account by typing an email and a password (requires a capital letter). This will sign you in as well. Or type your existing credentials and click "Sign In".
2. Click on a date to see its stored events. 
3. Add an event by typing its title and start/end time, then clicking "Add Event".

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Data validation with event start/end times.
* [ ] Increase security by adding more validation to the sign-in page.
