## Software Description
Project Idea: We want to create a website for a shared calendar that helps students keep track of events together. The calendar will send alerts to remind students about events one day in advance, so they donâ€™t forget.

**Shared Calendar**
   - A simple calendar view (monthly, weekly, daily).
   - Users can create, edit, and delete events together.
 
**Event Reminders**
   - Automatic reminders sent one day before events.
   - Users can choose their own reminder settings.

This plan will help us focus on the key features we need to get started, making sure the calendar meets students' needs while allowing us to add more features later.
